🍎 **Nutrition Dataset Analysis**

🧠 **Overview**

Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases. This project analyzes a nutrition dataset to understand dietary patterns, caloric intake, and nutrient distribution. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about how different food choices impact health and lifestyle, helping promote balanced diets and informed decisions.

This analysis was part of my data analytics learning journey, leveraging Python, visualization libraries, and storytelling to interpret real-world health data.

📂 **Dataset**

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umangsinghal5/nutritional-and-carbon-footprint-data-of-indian-diet

Description: The dataset contains details of food items and their nutritional components such as calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals.


🎯 **Objectives**

Understand the distribution of calories and macronutrients.

Identify the highest and lowest nutrient-rich food items.

Explore correlations between different nutrients (e.g., protein vs fat).

Visualize dietary patterns for better health recommendations.

🔍 **Analysis Process**
✅ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values.

Standardized food category names.

Removed duplicates.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics of calories and nutrients.

Correlation analysis of macronutrients.

Identification of outliers (e.g., extremely high-calorie foods).

✅ Data Visualization

Bar charts for nutrient distribution.

Histograms for calorie ranges.

Scatter plots for protein vs fat relationships.

Heatmaps for correlation among nutrients.

📊 **Key Insights**

Calorie-Rich Foods: Certain fast-food items had extremely high calories and fats compared to natural foods.

Protein vs Fat Trade-off: High-protein foods often had moderate to high fat content, impacting dietary balance.

Fiber & Vitamins: Whole foods like fruits and vegetables scored best in vitamins and fiber but lowest in calories.


🛠️ **Tools Used**

Python – Data analysis & visualization

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualizations
